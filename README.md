# Triangle-Peg-Solitaire
Full python solution to Triangle Peg Solitaire game using only the python standard library.  The python solution is in a game that can be played in any python idle shell.

The solution is based off the mathematical academic paper by George I. Bell, located here:Â https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703865
The code is easy to use and has no dependencies other than running on python 3.5. This was done intentionally, there are no other libraries being used to execute the code.  

Because of George I. Bell's paper the triangle peg solitaire is expandable and playable to infinity. It might be really hard to play due to the character with restrictions on the screen but all the math still works out and he can still be played and it is really fun. 
The minimum playable board for this game is four rows and up and that's because according to George that is the minimum number of rows that this game can be solved for, but for example if you wanted to have 250 rows you can and all the rules will adapt to that number of rows whatever it maybe.

When I was very young my parents bought me a wooden board game to keep me entertained while we went on road trips, this was before video games were portable. One of the board games that they got me was the Original IQ tester.  Below is the website also by George Bell, that has pictures including the original board game that I was inspired to do this:

Please if you have any issues or problems with the code don't hesitate to ask.
